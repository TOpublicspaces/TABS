TABS on Toronto is a civic engagement tool developed by the Toronto Public Space Initiative in 2012, which allows anonymous users to monitor the City of Toronto's council agendas and meeting minutes.  

Tabs makes accessing government records easy, by offering keyword searches, filters, and related information suggestions. Plus, you can sign up to receive email alerts whenever your search terms are posted in the future.  

If you are an engaged resident, policy expert, journalist or busy bureaucrat, this is the tool for you.
